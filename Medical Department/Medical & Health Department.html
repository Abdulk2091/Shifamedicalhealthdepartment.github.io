  <img src="1 Img.jpg" alt="Image 1" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br>
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A health department or health
    ministry is a part of government which focuses on issues related to the general
    health of the citizenry. Subnational entities, such as states, counties and cities, often also operate a health
    department of their own. Health departments perform food inspections and other health related inspections (the
    person who performs this job is often called a public health inspector), vaccination programs, free STD and HIV
    tests, tobacco enforcement and cessation programs, and other medical assistance programs. Health departments also
    compile statistics about health issues within their area. The role of a health department may vary from one country
    to the other, but their primary objective is always the same; safeguarding and promoting health. In 1986, several of
    the world's national health departments met to establish an international guideline by which health departments
    operate. The meeting was in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and hence the guidelines established are known as the Ottawa
    Charter. The Ottawa Charter was designed to 'achieve Health for All'.</p>
  <h2 style="margin: 10px; margin-left: 7px; margin-left: 10px;"><u>Programs and services</u></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 390px; font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">In the United States, the
    Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for coordinating health programs
    in the country. With more than 100 programs and services, the United States Department of Health and Human Services
    (HHS) aims to "protect the health of all Americans and provide essential human services, especially for those who
    are least able to help themselves."These federal programs consist of social service programs, civil rights and
    healthcare privacy programs, disaster preparedness programs, and health related research. HHS offers a variety of
    social service programs geared toward persons with low income, disabilities, military families, and senior
    citizens.Healthcare rights are defined under HHS in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
    (HIPAA) which protect patient's privacy in regards to medical information. HHS collaborates with the Office of the
    Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and Office of Emergency Management to prepare and respond to
    health emergencies.</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A broad array of health related
    research is supported or completed under the HHS;
    secondarily under HHS, the Health Resources & Service Adm inistration houses data warehouses and makes health data
    available surrounding a multitude of topics.HHS also has vast offering of health related resources and
    tools. Some examples of available resources include disease prevention, wellness, health insurance information, as
    well as links to healthcare providers and facilities, meaningful health related materials, and public health and
    safety information</p>
  <h2><u>Grants and contracts</u></h2>
  <img src="3 img.jpg" alt="3 Image" style="float: left; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"
    width="30%">
  <img src="2 img.avif" alt="2 Image" width="30%" style="float: right; margin-top: -480px;">
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px; margin-right: 10px;">The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) acts as the most extensive grant funding agency in
    the country.While several grants are delivered to non-government agencies, the majority of HHS federal grants
    are administered to states, territories, and tribes.Beneficiaries of federal funds are prohibited from lobbying
    government officials for legislative influence or additional funding.HHS and the National Institutes of Health,
    are accountable to Congress for conducting research that is amenable to both federal and state regulatory policies
    and a cost-effective budget.HHS uses grants to finance and encourage government research interests.
    Additionally, HHS routinely sets fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts with private companies in order to
    obtain products and services for government operations.HHS aims to issue these contracts with adherence to
    federal contract laws, HHS acquisition policies, and local operating procedures.</p>
  <h2 style="margin: 10px; margin-left: 7px; margin-left: 10px;"><u>Public Health</u></h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 350px; margin-left: 10px; font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">Public health is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the
    organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and
    individuals".Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for
    public health.The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in
    the case of a pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of health takes into account physical,
    psychological, and social well-being.Public health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology,
    biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields
    include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health </p><p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;">economics, public policy, mental health,
    health education, health politics, occupational safety, disability, oral health, gender issues in health, and sexual
    and reproductive health.Public health, together with primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, is part of
    a country's overall healthcare system. Public health is implemented through the surveillance of cases and health
    indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promotion of
    hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, promoting ventilation and improved air quality both
    indoors and outdoors, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility
    and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
